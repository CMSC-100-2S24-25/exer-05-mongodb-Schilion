### Section

### Key Takeaways
- I learned the importance of organizing an Express.js project using the MVC pattern. Separating the server, routes, controllers, and models makes the code more readable and easier to maintain
- I gained hands-on experience using Mongoose to interact with MongoDB. I learned how to define schemas, create models, and perform CRUD operations such as inserting, updating, and deleting student records using methods like updateOne() and deleteOne().
- Instead of relying on manual testing with Postman, I used Needle to send automated HTTP requests and verify that my API was working correctly. This helped me debug faster and ensure that the server responded with the expected JSON data.
